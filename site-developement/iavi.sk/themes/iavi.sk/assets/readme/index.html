		<h3 id="intro"><strong>A) Introduction</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>The main source code for "CSS3 Shadow Pack" is contained in the file called "shadows.css". There are 11 different shadow styles and
		   each style in turn comes in 3 intensity variations and 3 length variations, thus providing you with 99 variations in total !
		</p>

		<p>Applying a particular shadow style to a html container is very simple. You just have to add the appropriate class names to the
		   container. This aspect has been divided into 3 parts. First and foremost you have to add the class name that identifies a particular
		   shadow style. Then you have to add another class name for the shadow projection length you want for that particular shadow style. Finally
		   add another class name for the shadow intensity that you want.
		</p>

		<p>For eg. suppose that you want to add a warp shadow to <code>&lt;div id="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> Also say you want that to
		   have a large projection length (relatively speaking) and a medium intensity. Then the class names that you would add would look this:
		</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;div id="container" class="WarpShadow WLarge WNormal"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

		<p>That would produce a nice looking warp shadow on that div. The class names for all the shadow styles will be stated in the next section.
		</p>

		<p>Since these shadows are created by using <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code> pseudo elements, therefore they will only work on
		   elements that support those pseudo elements. Hence if you try to apply these shadows directly to an <code>img</code> tag, it will not
		   work ( except in Opera which supports <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code> for <code>img</code> tag ). This also holds true for
		   form input elements. So if you find that these shadows are not working when you apply them to a certain html tag, then just wrap that
		   tag with a <code>div</code> and apply the shadow to that <code>div</code> instead. With all that being said, these shadows will work
		   directly on the majority of html tags that are in common use.
		</p>

		<p>As to browser support, these shadows will work in Firefox 3.5+, Safari 3.2+, Chrome 3.0+, Opera 10.50+, and IE8+. Support for IE has been
		   provided as of v2.0 .  The files/scripts used to produce the shadows in IE are contained in the folder named "shadows-for-ie". Applying the
		   shadow styles in IE is the same as in the other browsers and the details will be given below. Also note that 3 new shadow styles
		   included in v2.0 - "Hover Shadow", "Stand Shadow", "Fold Shadow", require a bit of javascript help to work in Safari. These javascript files
		   have been included in their respective demo folders.
		</p>

		<hr>


		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>B) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>As mentioned earlier the shadow styles are all defined in "shadows.css", which is contained in the folder called "Source". This file
		   has been divided into sections using css comments, and the individual sections constitute the shadow styles. Further each section also
		   contains style blocks defining the shadow projection lengths and intensity variations.
		</p>

		<p>The major sections are:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
	/******* WARP SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* RIGHT SIDE WARP SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* LEFT SIDE WARP SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* LEFT SIDE PERSPECTIVE SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* RIGHT SIDE PERSPECTIVE SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* BOTTOM PERSPECTIVE SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* HOVER SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* STAND SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* FOLD SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* RIGHT SIDE CURL SHADOW ********/

	some code

	/******* LEFT SIDE CURL SHADOW ********/
</pre>

		<p>If you would like to edit a specific section of the file, simply find the appropriate label in the CSS file, and then scroll down until you find the appropriate style that needs to be edited.</p>

		<p>Given below are the available class names for each shadow style and their corresponding projection lengths and intensity :</p>

		<p>An important thing to note is that the 3 warp shadow varieties have an extra class name called <strong>smallBox</strong>, that is to be
		   applied to html containers having widths between 150px and 350px. If that class name is not applied to such boxes then the shadows will
		   inevitably look bad. So please keep that in mind. This point has also been indicated in comments in "shadows.css". Similarly the Left
		   and Right Side Perspective shadows will only work for boxes having size greater than 150 x 150 px . But no special class name has been
		   provided here. This fact has also been indicated in the css file using comments. In fact all the shadow styles provided will look good on
		   large boxes, that have width greater than 400px or so. Use your discretion in applying a proper shadow style to a box of a particular
		   size.
		</p>

		<p>When you apply a shadow style to particular container, then <strong>DO NOT</strong> forget to set a z-index on its immediate parent container.
		   On failing to do so will make the shadows invisible, especially if the parent has a background set. This happens because the pseudo elements
		   <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code> have a z-index of -1, in order for the shadows to remain below the container to which they are applied.
		   So for eg. if you want to apply a shadow to say <code>&lt;div id="someShadow"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, and its parent is say <code>&lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
		   then you would set the follwing style on div#wrapper
		</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
	#wrapper {
	    position: relative;
	    z-index: 0;
	}
</pre>

		<p>Note that a position declaration is required to set a z-index on a container. If you already have a position set on the parent container then
		   of course there is no need to do it again. Also setting a <code>z-index: 0</code> is enough to make the shadows visible, but if your project
		   requires setting a higher z-index on div#wrapper then that is alright too. It must be mentioned here that if the container to which you are
		   applying the shadow is a direct child of the body element, then there is no need to set a z-index on the body element as shown above, and the shadows
		   will show just fine.
		</p>


		<p>
		   Another important thing worth mentioning is that, the html container to which you apply the shadow, must have a suitable bottom
		   margin ( left/right margin if you use Left/Right Perspective Shadow or Left/Right Curl Shadow ). This is needed because then otherwise the succeeding
		   container will ignore the presence of the shadow of its previous container and overlap it. Depending on its z-index, the succeeding
		   container will either go above or below the shadow of its previous container. This is in fact a standard feature of css box-shadows.
		   So you must apply a proper bottom margin to the conatiner to which you apply the shadow. You may also instead add a suitable top margin
		   to the succeeding container. Its your choice !
		</p>

		<p>An example of applying these class names has already been given above. For further illustrations please check the provided demo files and
		   their source code to get a proper grasp of this.
		</p>

		<p>Also note that you must not add more than one class name for shadow projection lengths or intensity. The same goes for shadow styles
		   also.
		</p>

		<p>Great care has been taken to make the shadows look good in all modern CSS3 capable browsers. But still there can be slight rendering
		   differences between browsers in some cases. The shadow projection lengths and intensity variations have been designed in such a way so
		   that they look good in most situations. But you may of course feel the need to tweak the parameters to your taste. Feel free to do so !
		</p>

		<p>On a final note, if you find that you are not using more than one or two shadow styles for a particular project, then it would be better
		   if you copied just those shadow styles to your main style sheet. In doing so you will save some bandwidth, instead of including the whole
		   shadows.css file, and also the page will render slighltly faster.

		<h3 id="ieshadow"><strong>C) Instructions for IE and Safari</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>As mentioned earlier the method for applying shadows in IE are quite similar to other browsers. You will of course have to declare the class names as
		   mentioned above. The only difference is that some extra scripts have to be included to make the shadows work in IE. The shadows work in IE through
		   a combination of javascript, proprietary IE filters, and <a href="http://css3pie.com">CSS3 PIE</a>. For javascript, the <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> library is used.
           So to make the shadows work in IE you have to include the following code block in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your html file.
		</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;!--[if IE 8]&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../../shadows-for-ie/shadows-ie.css" /&gt;
    &lt;script src="http://ie7-js.googlecode.com/svn/version/2.1(beta4)/IE9.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="../../shadows-for-ie/jquery.transform-0.9.3.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="../../shadows-for-ie/shadows-ie.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</pre>

		<p>The files used here are:<p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>shadows-ie.css</strong> - The main css file that contain the shadow style declarations suitable for IE</li>
			<li><strong>Dean Edwards' IE9.js</strong> - This file makes IE behave like a standards compliant browser and provides support for some features that
			    are present in other modern browsers, but are absent in IE. Strictly speaking this file is not absolutely necessary in this case, but
				it produces one feature that is helpful for inlcuding CSS3 PIE, that is explained below.</li>
			<li><strong>jQuery</strong> - A javascript framework that makes coding javascript much easier. Here the latest version at the moment of writing is being
			    referenced from Google servers.</li>
			<li><a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/2d-transform"><strong>jQuery 2d Transform Plugin</strong></a> - This plugin makes css3 transforms work in IE
			    through the use of IE filters.</li>
			<li><strong>shadows-ie.js</strong> - The javascript file that contains the code for making all the shadow styles work in IE. If you only want to use
			    one or two shadow styles in your project then you can delete the portions from this file that you don't need. This file has been
				commented to divide the sections for different shadow styles.</li>
			<li><strong>CSS3 PIE</strong> - This file has not been explicitly referenced like the above files. Instead it is referenced from within the shadows-ie.css.
			    if you go through that css file then you will find declarations like <code>behavior: url(PIE.htc);</code>. That is how CSS3 PIE is referenced.
				This htc file makes a lot of css3 features work in IE, that includes box-shadows. Note here that generally the url path of a htc file declared
				like above is made relative to the html file, and not relative to the css file from where it is referenced. Dean Edwards' IE9.js corrects this
				non-standard behaviour in IE, and hence you can delcare the htc file path relative to shadows-ie.css . So if you choose not to include IE9.js
				then you must keep this fact in mind.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>As you can clearly see, the above files have been referenced through conditional comments, so that they are only loaded in IE. Further the conditional
		   comments stipulate that these files be only loaded for IE8. These shadows do not work in IE7 due to a z-index bug, which make the shadows appear on top
		   of the conatiner to which they are applied.
		</p>

		<p>As for Safari, it has been already mentioned that it requires the help of javascript to make 3 new shadow styles work. This is due to the fact that Safari has
		   a bug in the use of percentage values in elliptical border-radius. Here also the help of jQuery is taken. The javascript files for these 3 shadow styles
		   are included in the respective demo folders. Note here that since jQuery is required for these 3 cases to make the shadows work in Safari, so for these cases
		   jQuery should not be included within conditional comments, as is done for IE. See the demo files to understand how the files have been referenced. Please note that this Safari bug has been fixed in version 5.1+ .
